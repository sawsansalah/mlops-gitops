I'll fetch the Medusa.js installation documentation to see what information is available about Helm installation.

1.2. Install Medusa - Medusa Documentation

I can see from the documentation that it mentions Docker as an alternative installation method. Let me check that page for Helm information.

Let me search for Medusa Helm chart information:


Medusa.js Helm chart installation
10 results





















Based on my research, here's what I found about Helm installation for Medusa.js:

Helm Installation for Medusa.js
Official Support Status: There's a GitHub issue from 2022 requesting Kubernetes Helm support for Medusa components 
GitHub
, but Medusa.js does not officially provide a Helm chart.

The official Medusa documentation only mentions:

Installing via npx create-medusa-app (recommended)
Installing with Docker (alternative)
Using Medusa Cloud (PaaS platform)
Unofficial Helm Charts: The search results show several Helm charts, but these are for "Medusa" - a TV show manager application, which is completely different from Medusa.js (the e-commerce platform). These include charts from:

These are NOT for the Medusa.js e-commerce platform you're asking about.

Your Installation Options:
Since there's no official Helm chart for Medusa.js, your options are:

Use Docker - The official alternative to local installation
Use Medusa Cloud - Their managed PaaS platform
Create your own Helm chart - You'd need to containerize the Medusa application and create a custom Helm chart
Standard Kubernetes deployment - Deploy using standard Kubernetes manifests
Would you like help with any of these alternatives, or would you like guidance on creating a custom Helm chart for Medusa.js?
